"""ADW Simple SDLC — plan, build, deterministic quality, review, and document.

Usage:
    uv run adws/adw_simple_sdlc.py "<prompt or path/to/prompt.md>" [--config adws/adw_codectory_config/codectory.config.yaml] [--adw-id a1b2c3d4]

Phases: engineer(request) -> planner -> git(commit_plan)
        -> builder -> code(changed-project quality) [-> builder(fix) ... bounded]
        -> reviewer [-> builder(revise) -> reviewer ... bounded]
        -> code(recheck, only if a revision changed files)
        -> git(commit_build) -> code(changes) -> documenter -> git(commit_docs)

Three commits, three work products, three authors. The plan, the code, and the
write-up each land in their own commit, and each commit message is the words of
the agent that produced it — `commit_message` on PlanOutput describes the spec,
on BuildOutput the code, on DocumentOutput the write-up. No agent's sentence is
ever reused for another agent's diff.

Quality is CODE, not an agent. Commands (including tests) come from
`projects.yaml`, run from each changed project's directory, and travel back to
the builder as one aggregate failure envelope. No agent rediscovers runners.

Two different questions still get asked, in order. The suite asks "does it
run"; the reviewer asks "is this what was asked for", against `plan.md` — and
neither can answer the other's. A revision that closes a review finding
re-enters the suite, so the tree that gets committed is the tree that was both
tested and approved.

The code commit lands after verification, not straight after the build: fixes
and revisions are part of the same work product, and red code has no business
on the branch. A run that fails verification therefore leaves the plan
committed and the working tree dirty — the spec is a real artifact either way,
and the unfinished code stays where the engineer can see it.

The documenter measures against the commit this run STARTED from, not against
`main`, because by then the run has moved `main` itself. That baseline is
pinned before the first commit phase and printed in the request phase.
